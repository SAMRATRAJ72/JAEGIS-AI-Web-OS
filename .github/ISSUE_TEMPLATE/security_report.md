## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Use Private Security Advisory

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities using public issues.**

Instead, please use GitHub's private security advisory feature:

1. Go to [Security Advisories](https://github.com/usemanusai/JAEGIS-AI-Web-OS/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the private security advisory form

Alternatively, email us at [security@usemanusai.com](mailto:security@usemanusai.com)

## Why Use Private Reporting?

- **Responsible Disclosure**: Allows us to fix the issue before public disclosure
- **User Protection**: Prevents exploitation while we develop a fix
- **Coordinated Response**: Enables proper security response procedures
- **Recognition**: You'll be credited for responsible disclosure

## What Happens Next?

1. **Immediate Response**: We'll respond within 24 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll evaluate the severity and impact
3. **Fix Development**: We'll work on a security patch
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll work with you on public disclosure timing
5. **Recognition**: You'll be credited in our security advisory

## Security Contact Information
