## 🛠️ Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
```bash
# Always verify package integrity
npm audit
pip-audit

# Use official sources only
npm install jaegis-ai-web-os
pip install jaegis-ai-web-os
```

### Configuration Security
```bash
# Use environment variables for API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"

# Never commit API keys to version control
echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
echo "api_keys.json" >> .gitignore
```

### Document Processing Security
```bash
# Enable sandbox mode for untrusted documents
jaegis-ai-web-os build --base untrusted.docx --sandbox

# Validate document sources
jaegis-ai-web-os analyze --security-check document.pdf
```

### Network Security
```bash
# Use HTTPS for all API communications
export MCP_USE_HTTPS="true"

# Configure proxy if needed
export HTTPS_PROXY="https://proxy.company.com:8080"
```

## 🔍 Security Auditing

### Automated Security Measures
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated security scanning on every commit

## 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Code Security
- ❌ Using `eval()` or `exec()` with user input
- ❌ Hardcoding secrets in source code
- ❌ Insufficient input validation
- ❌ Exposing sensitive information in error messages
- ❌ Using deprecated or vulnerable dependencies

### Configuration Security
- ❌ Default passwords or API keys
- ❌ Overly permissive file permissions
- ❌ Unencrypted storage of sensitive data
- ❌ Logging sensitive information
- ❌ Insecure temporary file handling
